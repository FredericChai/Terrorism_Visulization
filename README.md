# Terrorism_Visulization
 
This repo is for course 5048 Visual Analytics mid-term assignment (USYD Schoold of Computer Science) 

The range of visualisations generated tell a compelling and concise story of the evolution of global terrorism over the last 47 years. It also shows some hidden trends and patterns within the recorded incidents and unexpected relationships between different terrorist attacks for readers of the report and provide answers to several specific terrorism related questions.

This visualisation aims to identify the temporal patterns as well as the relative importance of each value . Figure 1 shows all deadly terrorist attacks, by location, with the size of the bubble depicting the number of fatalities and the red vs yellow colour depicting whether any of the attackers suicided in the process. The top left graph shows the five years leading up to 9/11 and top right graph shows the five years immediately following 9/11. It is striking to see how the method of attack shifted to the inclusion of suicide as a key element in many attacks after 9/11; how the deadliness of attacks increased and also how the concentration of attacks diminished in the Americas, whilst increasing in the middle-east.
